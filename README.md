## Synopsis

iB4e-GTFold-parametrizer determines the sensitivity of RNA folding to multibranch-loop-related parameters.

## Installation

This project is under active development, so we recommend downloading it using Git.
To do this, run the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/AMS-MRC-disc-math-bio/iB4e-GTfold-parametrizer.git
```

This will download the code and extract it into a directory called `iB4e-GTfold-parameterizer`.

### Dependencies
This project depends on the [CGAL][cgal] computational geometry library, several libraries from the [Boost][boost] project, and the [GMP][gmp] arbitrary-precision arithmetic library.
To install the required dependencies on a Debian system, run

    sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libcgal-dev


This project also depends on the [NLTemplate] string templating library.
It has been included here under the terms of the MIT license.


### Building the project code
Next, you will need to build our custom version of `GTFold`.
To do so, simply run `make` from the `iB4e-GTfold-parametrizer` directory.
This will automatically run all the required build steps, including handling the `CGAL` subdirectory.

## Updating

If you used Git to download your copy of this software, you can update it easily.
Just run `git pull` in a terminal from anywhere inside the repository to fetch the latest version.

## Usage

Given a FASTA file representing an RNA sequence, the program will produce a Sage file representing the regions of ‚Ñù<sup>3</sup> in which given structures are optimal.

To run the calculation on the sequence in `testseq.fasta`, type

    ./parametrizer.py -s testseq.fasta

The result will be a file `testseq.polytope.sage` containing the required Sage commands and a directory called `testseq` containing structure files representing the MFE structures for each set of parameters.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests in the files `test_GTrunner.py` and `test_RNAscorer.py`.
Simply run each of these scripts from your shell to test the functionality of the associated program.
If any of the tests fail, please be sure your build of the C code in `gtmfe/` is up to date; if the tests continue to fail, please contact the author with information about your computer architecture, operating system, and compiler.
