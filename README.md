## Synopsis

iB4e-GTFold-parametrizer determines the sensitivity of RNA folding to multibranch-loop-related parameters.

## Prerequisites

You will need the `gtmfe` and `RNAScoring` programs from the [GTFold][gtfold] project.
Download and build them according to the instructions provided at the project site.
Be sure to run `make install` so that these are available in your path.

You will also need a working Python environment.

## Installation

You can obtain the code in two ways:

1. By cloning this repository to your computer, or
1. By downloading a ZIP archive of the current state.

Once you have obtained the code, you will need to build our custom version of iB4e.
Run the `compile_iB4e` script in the `iB4e` directory to set it up.

## Usage

Given a FASTA file representing an RNA sequence, the program will produce a Sage file representing the regions of ‚Ñù<sup>3</sup> in which given structures are optimal.

To run the calculation on the sequence in `testseq.fasta`, type

    ./iB4erunner.py -s testseq.fasta

The result will be a file `testseq.sage` containing the required Sage commands.
